# Developer Guide

Welcome developers! This guide documents how to extend the autonomy stack for your own needs.
The stack has been designed with modularity in mind, and aims to make it straight forward to swap out any component.

```bash
# clean workspace, removes all build and install directories
cws 
# build workspace and source workspace. these are aliases in ~/.bashrc
bws && sws  
```
